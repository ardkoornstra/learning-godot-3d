# Learning 3D Game Development in Godot

A repository of projects I made while learning how to develop games in Godot, following a course on [Gamedev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/). The project files and executables of three games are included.

Special thanks to [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) for some of the assets used.
